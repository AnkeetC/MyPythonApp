# CI/CD Pipeline for Hello World Python Application

This repository contains a simple Python application that prints 'Hello World!' and demonstrates a basic CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, Docker, and Kubernetes.

## CI/CD Pipeline Overview

The CI/CD pipeline consists of the following key steps:

1. **Version Control Setup:**
   - Created a GitHub repository for the Python FastAPI application.
   
2. **GitHub Actions Workflow:**
   - Configured a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically trigger on every push to the `main` branch.
   - Set up Python, installed dependencies, ran tests, built a Docker image, and optionally pushed it to Docker Hub.
   - Deployed the application to Minikube and exposed it as a NodePort service.
   - Installed Prometheus, Prometheus Node Exporter, and Grafana for monitoring.

3. **Dockerization:**
   - Created a Dockerfile to containerize the Python application.
   - Built and pushed the Docker image to Docker Hub.

4. **Kubernetes Deployment:**
   - Used `kubectl` to deploy the application to Minikube.
   - Exposed the deployment as a NodePort service for local access.
   - Installed Prometheus, Prometheus Node Exporter, and Grafana in the Kubernetes cluster.

5. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Set up basic monitoring and logging for the deployed application.
   - Configured alerts or notifications for deployment failures.
   - Used Prometheus for monitoring and Grafana for visualization.

## Steps to Reproduce

To reproduce this CI/CD pipeline on your machine:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnkeetC/MyPythonApp.git'''
   
   1. Follow the steps in the GitHub Actions workflow file (./.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml).

## GitHub Actions Workflow
The GitHub Actions workflow is defined in the .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml file. It performs the following steps:

Set up the environment.
Install dependencies and run tests.
Build and push the Docker image.
Deploy the application to Minikube.
Install Prometheus, Prometheus Node Exporter, and Grafana.

## Dockerization

The Python application is dockerized using a Dockerfile (./Dockerfile). The Docker image is built and pushed to Docker Hub during the CI/CD workflow.

## Kubernetes Deployment

I have used command '''kubectl create deployment hello-world-app --image=ankeetchauhan505/hello-world-app:latest --port=8080
          kubectl expose deployment hello-world-app --type=NodePort --port=8080 ''' to simplfy thr deployment of the application.
As an add on I have added deployment.yml and service.yml file as will in my git repository.

## Monitoring and Logging
Basic monitoring and logging are set up using Prometheus, Prometheus Node Exporter, and Grafana. 
Alerts or notifications are configured for deployment failures.
configuring alerts using Prometheus and Grafana.

### This README.md file serves as documentation for the setup and configuration of the entire CI/CD process.

### All required steps are mentioned in the workflow file, you can replace your Python application and resue the workflow file to BUILD/TEST/DEPLOY your application. I have also added the step in my GitHub workflow file so that it can run using the deployment and service files and complete the process.
